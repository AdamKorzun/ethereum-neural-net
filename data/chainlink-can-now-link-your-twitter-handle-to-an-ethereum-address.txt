Linking a personal Twitter handle to a public Ethereum address can be used as a form of identity verification when sending funds. Therefore, crypto users can confirm the identity of the individual they are sending funds to after entering the ETH address rather than the normal procedure of double-checking, and sometimes triple checking the Ethereum address.
The tweet above by the team at ChainLink includes a video that illustrates the following process of linking your Twitter handle to an Ethereum address.
First, you need to register a blockchain domain [at UnstoppableDomains.com]
Then you point your domain to a Twitter account you own by signing a message with your private key.
Next, you send out a tweet from your Twitter account to prove they truly own it. This tweet is then fetched by a Chainlink-powered decentralized oracle network, cryptographically hashed, and stored on the Ethereum blockchain to tie it to a specific domain name.
Last, you go into a wallet, type in the blockchain domain, and see the Twitter account displayed before sending money.
In terms of price action, ChainLink has benefited positively from the news of PayPal providing crypto services to its users. Since the PayPal news broke, ChainLink has managed to break several resistance levels including the ones found at the $10.80 and $11.20 price areas.
At the time of writing, LINK is trading at $11.70 and is eyeing to break the $11.80 resistance zone. If the current bullish momentum persists, ChainLink (LINK) could have a go at the $12 resistance area in the hours or days to follow.
