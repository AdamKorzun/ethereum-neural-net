In terms of market performance, UniSwap (UNI) is ranked 35th on Coinmarketcap with a market capitalization of $560 Million. Such a high ranking is also another noteworthy milestone given that UniSwap (UNI) token was only launched a month ago on 17th September.
UNI is currently trading at $3.02 which is a 64.2% drop from its all-time high value of $8.44 set on the 18th of September. A quick glance at the 4-hour chart of UNI/USDT reveals that the token could be gearing up for a few bullish days having experienced a local bottom around $2.45 on October 6th.
However, due to a very short trading history of one month, there is very little historical data to provide a comprehensive macro analysis of the future price of UniSwap (UNI). But going by the strong fundamentals shared above, UniSwap (UNI) could be gearing up for a very bright future in the crypto-markets.
