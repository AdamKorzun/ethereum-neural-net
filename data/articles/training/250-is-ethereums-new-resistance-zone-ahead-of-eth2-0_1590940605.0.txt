With the launch of ETH2.0 expected before the end of July, Ethereum currently has the $250 price zone as resistance leading up to the event. This is after Ethereum broke the earlier mentioned resistance zone of between $225 and $228. Therefore, the price of Ethereum still has room to grow in anticipation of the eagerly awaited ETH2.0 upgrade that will usher in a new era of stacking for the network.
Further checking the 6-hour ETH/USDT chart courtesy of Tradingview.com, we observe the following.
