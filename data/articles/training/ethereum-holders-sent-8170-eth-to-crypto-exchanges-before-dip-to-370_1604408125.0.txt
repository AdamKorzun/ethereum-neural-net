The selling of Ethereum begun around the $400 price zone. This could signify that this price area was the last region that some ETH investors could sell their bags at a profit. Additionally, it could be the first sign of exhaustion for Ethereum at least for the month of November.

Further checking the daily ETH/USDT chart above, Ethereum could be in the midst of printing a bear flag that could result in the retest of several support zones above $300. They include those found at $365, $336, $320 and $309.
Also from the chart, the following can be observed.
The 50-day moving average is providing a level of support at the $370 price area
The 200-day MA is providing adequate support at the $300 price area
Failure of the aforementioned support zones could lead to Ethereum dropping to as low as $250
Trade volume is in the red with the daily MACD confirming bearishness for Ethereum
The daily MFI and RSI are also hinting at a correction at values of 58 and 46 respectively
Summing it up, Ethereum holders transferred 8,170 ETH to crypto exchanges before yesterday’s drop from $400 to $370. The transfer and subsequent selling could hint of bullish exhaustion for Ethereum and could open the doors for a correction for the better part of November.
As with all analyses of Ethereum, traders and investors are advised to use adequate stop losses when trading ETH on the various derivatives platforms.
