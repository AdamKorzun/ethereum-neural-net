Furthermore, Crypto Analyst, Yassine Elmandjra of Ark Invest, further reiterated the possibility of there being a crypto wide bull season.
The 30-day BTC ETH correlation has dropped to 2.5 year lows. The last time we saw a drop this quick and dramatic was at the start of the 2017 boom.
Further checking the ETH/BTC chart courtesy of Tradingview, it can be observed that the value of Ethereum denominated in Bitcoin, is at the cusp of testing levels last seen in June 2019. Furthermore, the current Ethereum value at 0.0307 Satoshi was also experienced in December 2017 and before the massive push by Ethereum to $1,440 less than one month later.
Summing it up, the short term correlation between Ethereum and Bitcoin is beginning to drop. The last time there was a significant drop in its value was in 2017 and right before Ethereum catapulted to its all-time high value around $1,440.
Checking the ETH/BTC chart also reveals that Ethereum is gaining momentum against Bitcoin with its value of $0.0307 Sats last seen in June 2019 and December 2017. In the latter case, it preceded the massive drive up by all digital assets to their all-time high values in late 2017 and early 2018.
Although history does not usually repeat itself 100%, it might be prudent to consider that the crypto markets are at the beginning of a possible bull market.
