The document elaborates on how the payment processing company aims at creating a digital fiat currency or currencies using blockchain technology. The abstract section of the application explains that the issuance of the digital currency will be via a central entity computer. The patent was initially filed on November 8th, 2019 by inventors working at the Visa International Service Association based in San Francisco California.
In the description of the patent, the Ethereum network is mentioned several times. One instance where Ethereum has been mentioned can be found below. It gives a hint at VISA using the network to issue its digital fiat currency.
