In terms of the current value of Ethereum, ETH is once again attempting to claim the $390 resistance area as support. At the time of writing, Ethereum is trading exactly at $390 amidst the Bitcoin revival that has seen the King of Crypto bounce back from $12,900 levels to $13,487.
The bullishness of Bitcoin is one reason Ethereum could just turn the $390 price area into support and possibly attempt $400 in the days ahead. This is despite the fact that the daily ETH/USDT chart clearly hints of a correction for Ethereum. If Bitcoin can retest its recent high of $13,869, Ethereum might once again trade above $400.

Taking a closer look at the daily ETH/USDT chart above, the following can be observed.
Trade volume is in the red but hinting at a reduction in selling
The daily MACD is about to cross in a bearish manner above the baseline
The daily MFI and RSI point towards a correction for Ethereum at a value of 60 and 54 respectively
However, Ethereum’s price is above the 50, 100 and 200-day moving averages further foreshadowing a push up for Ethereum based on Bitcoin’s market momentum
The 50-day and 100-day MAs provide considerable support at the $380 price area
As with all analyses of Ethereum, traders and investors are advised to have an eye out for any Bitcoin moves that might ruin the party. Additionally, stop losses are advised given the fact that Bitcoin tends to ‘suck the capital’ from Ethereum and alts whenever it pumps hard.
