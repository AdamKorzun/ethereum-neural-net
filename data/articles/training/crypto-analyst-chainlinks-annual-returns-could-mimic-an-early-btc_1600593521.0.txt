Mr. Peterson has constantly used Metcalfe’s Law to highlight the relation between network activity and the value of the associated token. In this case, activity on the ChainLink network continues to grow with multiple crypto projects signing up to use the project’s price feeds.
In this past week alone, several crypto projects have announced their use of ChainLink’s price feeds. To begin with, TrustSwap announced that it will be using ChainLink’s ETH/USD price reference data for its SmartLock and SmartEscrow products.
Other crypto projects that announced the integration of ChainLink technology in the last week include SpectreAI, Matic Network, Zapper, Hacken, XinFin Network, Baseline protocol and Crypto.com.
In terms of the short term value of ChainLink in the crypto markets, Timothy Peterson has suggested that late September could be a possible time-frame for LINK to bottom in the crypto markets. He shared his price analysis of ChainLink via the following tweet that also highlighted that its value is tied to unique function calls on the ChainLink network.
