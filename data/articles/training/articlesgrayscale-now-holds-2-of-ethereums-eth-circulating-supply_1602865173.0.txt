Taking a second look at the value of Ethereum held by Grayscale, the amount of $869.7 Million represents roughly 2% of ETH’s total market capitalization of $41.5 Billion. This means that Grayscale currently holds 2% of Ethereum’s circulating supply of 113 Million ETH. Doing additional math, the Grayscale Ethereum Trust is comprised of roughly 2.260,607.88 ETH.
Grayscale Investments holding 2% of Ethereum’s circulating supply is very bullish for the long term ETH holder. Additionally, the team at Weiss Ratings has placed a possible 18% increment in value once ETH2.0 is launched and staking of Ethereum is available for everyone.
The analysis by Weiss Ratings is based on the fact that 50% of all Ethereum (ETH) has not moved in 12 months. This translates to roughly 56.5 Million ETH laying dormant in anticipation of ETH2.0. Below is the tweet by Weiss Ratings forecasting a bullish market environment for Ethereum once ETH2.0 is launched.
More than 50% of all #ETH hasn't moved in 12 months, but this may soon change with the launch of staking. If you’re one of the first to stake on #ETH2, you can expect gains of about 18% – and all this with hopefully very low risk.
